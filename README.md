<h1>Travel app:</h1>
<p>I built this travel-app using html, Sass and javascript. This was a very challenging, yet extremely fun project!</p>
<p>
I also used:
<ul>
<li>Node.js and Express framework
<il>Jest for testing
<li>Webpack
<li>Service Workers
<li>Axios
<li>AJAX
</ul>
My server runs on port 3000
</p>
<h3>I made use the following Scripts</h3>
<ul>
<li>npm run build-prod      (Runs in prod)
<li>npm run build-dev       (Runs in dev)   
<li>npm run test            (for testing)
<li>npm run start           (Starts the Server)
</ul>
